# Animation Wardrobe

Animation mods now made easy!

Assign animations to a button and view them in a catalogue.

To setup collections properly, inheritence is suggested:

1. Make a new collection in Penumbra (ex: "Emotes", "Animations")
2. Navigate to an outfit collection you'd normally have active.
3. Switch to the Collection Details tab.
4. Add the new collection you created to the inheritence table.

Repeat for any other outfits you have.

This ensures that you have a master collection for emotes that works for all of your collections that are being actively used.

In the wardrobe, simply assign each entry to work with the new collection and it will manage enabling and disabling the animation mods that are configured.
